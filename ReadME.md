## Purpose

This is an API that should randomly pick out a Whisky to try/ learn about.
It gives the proof, brand, type, and name.

##Current Stage: 
1. Building the initial data model. <br>

## Next Phases
2. After this, I'm going to add the DB using either AWS or Apache Cassandra [whichever has free setup].
3. I'm going to connect the Data to the Model using Spring's Annotations & Auto-Configuration options
to avoid the usual POJO to handle these objects.
4. I'm going to create the API handler for these.
5. I'm going to connect it to a UI. That UI should handle a GET/POST request. The DELETE request should be available at
the API level, but not utilized because only Admins should have that access.

## DB Access:
Information to come.

## Deployment
Information to come.
